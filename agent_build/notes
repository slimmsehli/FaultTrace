in the system prompt need to sepcify that before looking into any signal name in the vcd file
the agent should extract all the signal names presented in the design and tehn will search for a signal by name
#@TODO : the agent is free to check the DUT files
if the analysis is pointing to a bad response from the DUT the agent should check the DUT files for issues
