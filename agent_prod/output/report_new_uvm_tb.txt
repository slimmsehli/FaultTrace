Concise root cause & fix
- Root cause: DUT mis-indexes received address bits. After 8 MSB-first shifts the 7-bit address is in shift_reg[7:1], but the DUT compares shift_reg[6:0] to SLAVE_ADDR, so address match fails and DUT never drives ACK.
- File/location: /home/slim/FaultTrace/agent_prod/rtl/design.sv (MATCH_ADDR case, ~lines 76–83)
- One-line fix: change
    if (shift_reg[6:0] == SLAVE_ADDR) begin
  to
    if (shift_reg[7:1] == SLAVE_ADDR) begin

Verification steps
1. Apply the change in design.sv (line ~82).
2. Re-run /home/slim/FaultTrace/agent_prod/simulation/runme.csh.
3. Confirm sim.log no longer shows the UVM_ERROR and sim.vcd shows DUT asserting ACK (tb_top.dut.sda_out_en==1 and tb_top.intf.sda==0) during ACK sample.
